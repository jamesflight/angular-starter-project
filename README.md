Angular Starter Project
------------------------
My angular starter project.  Currently has:
* Gulp build process for js with concat, uglify, ng-annotate and sourcemaps
* Gulp build process for concatenation and automatic caching of html partials [ng-html2js](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ng-html2js)
* Protractor, with configured npm test command

I pinched the demo files from [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).
